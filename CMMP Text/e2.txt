The wild horse champs the Parthenon's top frieze
Since Elgin left his nostrils in the stone
The Turks said just take anything you please
And loudly sang off-key without a tone

O Parthenon you hold the charger's strings
The North Wind bites into his architrave
Th'outrageous Thames a troubled arrow slings
To break a rule Britannia's might might waive

Platonic Greece was not so talentless
A piercing wit would sprightliest horses flog
Socrates watched his hemlock effervesce

Their sculptors did our best our hulks they clog
With marble souvenirs then fill a slum
For Europe's glory while Fate's harpies strum
