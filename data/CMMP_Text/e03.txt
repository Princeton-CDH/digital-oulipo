At snuff no Cornish sailorman would sneeze
His nasal ecstasy beats best Cologne
Upon his old oak chest he cuts his cheese
With cherry-pips his cottage floor is sown

The Frisian Isles my friends are cherished things
Whose ocean still-born herrings madly brave
Such merchadise a melancholy brings
For burning bushes never fish forgave

When dried the terrapin can naught express
Shallots and sharks' fins face the smould'ring log
While homeward thirsts to each quenched glass say yes

Lobsters for sale must be our apologue
On fish-slab whale nor seal has never swum
They're kings we're mammal-cousins hi ho hum
