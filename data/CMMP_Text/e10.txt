The marble tomb gapes wide with jangling keys
When masons clutch the breath we held on loan
Forms shadowy with indecision wheeze
And empty cages show life's bird has flown

It's one of many horrid happenings
With sombre thoughts they grimly line the nave
Proud death quite il-le-gi-ti-mate-ly stings
Victorious worms grind all into the grave

It's no good rich men crying Heaven Bless
Or grinning like a pale-faced golliwog
Poor Yorick comes to bury not address

We'll suffocate before the epilogue
Poor reader smile before your lips go numb
The best of all things to an end must come
