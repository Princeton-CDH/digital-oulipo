From playboy Chance the nymph no longer flees
Through snobbish growing round her hemline zone
His toga rumpled high above his knees
One gathers rosebuds or grows old alone

Old Galileo's Pisan offerings
Were pots graffiti'd over by a slave
The leaning linguist cameramaniac sings
Etruscan words which Greece and Rome engrave

Emboggled minds may puff and blow and guess
With gravity at gravity's great cog
On wheels the tourist follows his hostess

With breaking voice across the Alps they slog
Do bank clerks rule their abacus by thumb?
In cognac brandy is Bacardi rum?
