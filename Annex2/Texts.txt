(Declaration) of (Independence)

When in the (Course) of human (events), it becomes necessary for one (people) to dissolve the 
political (bands) which have connected them with another, and to assume among the (powers) of 
the (earth), the separate and equal (station) to which the (Laws) of (Nature) and of (Nature)'s (God) 
entitle them, a decent (respect) to the (opinions) of (mankind) requires that they should 
declare the (causes) which impel them to the (separation).

We hold these (truths) to be self-evident, that all (men) are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their (Creator) with certain unalienable (Rights), that among these are (Life), 
(Liberty) and the (pursuit) of (Happiness).

(Genesis)

1 In the (beginning) (God) created the (heaven) and the (earth).
2 And the (earth) was without (form), and void; and (darkness) was upon the (face) of the (deep). 
And the (Spirit) of (God) moved upon the (face) of the (waters).
3 And (God) said, Let there be (light): and there was (light).
4 And (God) saw the (light), that it was good: and (God) divided the (light) from the (darkness).
5 And (God) called the (light) (Day), and the (darkness) he called (Night). And the (evening) and the 
(morning) were the first (day).

The (Raven)

Once upon a (midnight) dreary, while I pondered weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious (volume) of forgotten (lore),
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a (tapping),
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber (door).
`'Tis some (visitor),' I muttered, `tapping at my chamber (door) -
Only this, and nothing more.'

`(Prophet)!' said I, `(thing) of (evil)! - (prophet) still, if (bird) or (devil)!
By that (Heaven) that bends above us - by that (God) we both adore -
Tell this (soul) with (sorrow) laden if, within the distant (Aidenn),
It shall clasp a sainted (maiden) whom the (angels) name (Lenore) -
Clasp a rare and radiant (maiden), whom the (angels) name (Lenore)?'
Quoth the (raven), `Nevermore.'

`Be that (word) our (sign) of (parting), (bird) or (fiend)!' I shrieked upstarting -
`Get thee back into the (tempest) and the (Night)'s Plutonian (shore)!
Leave no black (plume) as a (token) of that (lie) thy (soul) hath spoken!
Leave my (loneliness) unbroken! - quit the (bust) above my (door)!
Take thy (beak) from out my (heart), and take thy (form) from off my (door)!'
Quoth the (raven), `Nevermore.'

And the (raven), never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid (bust) of (Pallas) just above my chamber (door);
And his (eyes) have all the (seeming) of a (demon)'s that is dreaming,
And the (lamp)-(light) o'er him streaming throws his (shadow) on the (floor);
And my (soul) from out that (shadow) that lies floating on the (floor)
Shall be lifted - nevermore!

A Tale of Two Cities

It was the (best) of (times), it was the (worst) of (times), it was the (age) of (wisdom), it was the 
(age) of (foolishness), it was the (epoch) of (belief), it was the (epoch) of (incredulity), it was 
the (season) of (Light), it was the (season) of (Darkness), it was the (spring) of (hope), it was the 
(winter) of (despair), we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all 
going direct to (Heaven), we were all going direct the other (way)--in short, the (period) was 
so far like the present (period), that some of its noisiest (authorities) insisted on its 
being received, for (good) or for (evil), in the superlative (degree) of (comparison) only.

There were a (king) with a large (jaw) and a (queen) with a plain (face), on the (throne) of 
(England); there were a (king) with a large (jaw) and a (queen) with a fair (face), on the (throne) of 
(France). In both (countries) it was clearer than (crystal) to the (lords) of the (State) (preserves) 
of (loaves) and (fishes), that (things) in (general) were settled for ever.

Moby Dick

Call me (Ishmael). Some (years) ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no (money) 
in my (purse), and nothing particular to interest me on (shore), I thought I would sail about 
a little and see the watery (part) of the (world). It is a (way) I have of driving off the 
(spleen) and regulating the (circulation). Whenever I find myself growing grim about the 
(mouth); whenever it is a damp, drizzly (November) in my (soul); whenever I find myself 
involuntarily pausing before (coffin) (warehouses), and bringing up the (rear) of every (funeral) 
I meet; and especially whenever my (hypos) get such an upper (hand) of me, that it requires a 
strong moral (principle) to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the (street), and 
methodically knocking (people)'s (hats) off- then, I account it high (time) to get to (sea) as 
soon as I can. This is my (substitute) for (pistol) and (ball). With a philosophical (flourish) 
(Cato) throws himself upon his (sword); I quietly take to the (ship). There is nothing 
surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all (men) in their (degree), some (time) or 
other, cherish very nearly the same (feelings) towards the (ocean) with me.
