When one with t'other straightaway agrees
The answer is they could be twins full-grown
Replies like this the dumbstruck brain may tease
Normal one aims to be and share the throne

And yet 'twas he the beggar Fate just flings
Rejecting ermine to become a knave
The fertile mother changelings drops like kings
In purest cradles tha's how they behave

The genealogist with field and fess
With quill white-collared through his life will jog
To prove mamma an adult with a tress

But I can understand you Brother Gog
And let you off from your opinions glum
A wise loaf always knows its humblest crumb
