The acid tongue with gourmet's expertise
Licks round carved marble chops on snails full-blown
The showman gargles fire and sword with ease
While sharks to let's say potted shrimps are prone

The roundabout eats profits made on swings
Nought can the mouse's timid nibbling stave
In salads all chew grubs before they've wings
The nicest kids for stickiest toffees crave

The wolf devours both sheep and shepherdess
A bird-brain banquet melts bold Mistress Mog
The country lane just thrives on farmyard mess

Whiskey will always wake an Irish bog
Though bretzels take the dols from board-room drum
Fried grilled black pudding's still the world's best yum
