At five precisely out went La Marquise
For tea cucumber sandwiches a scone
Her native chauffeur waited in the breeze
Which neither time nor tide can long postpone

How it surprised us pale grey underlings
When flame a form to wrath ancestral gave
A daring baron pockets precious Mings
Till firemen come with hose-piped tidal wave

The fasting fakir doesn't smell the less
In Indian summers Englishmen drink grog
The colonel's still escutcheoned in undress

No need to cart such treasures from the fog
The Taj Mahal has trinkets spice and gum
And lessors' dates have all too short a sum
