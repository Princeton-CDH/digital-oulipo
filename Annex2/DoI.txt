Declaration of Independence

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the 
political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of 
the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God 
entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should 
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, 
Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
