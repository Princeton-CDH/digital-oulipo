He bent right down to pick up his valise
That hordes of crooks felt they'd more right to own
He bent right down and well what did he seize
The thumb- and finger-prints of Al Capone

Oh how oh how he hates such pilferings
Filching the lolly country thrift helped save
He's gone to London how the echo rings
Through homestead hillside woodland rock and cave

The peasant's skirts on rainy days she'd tress
And starve the snivelling baby like a dog
Watching manure and compost coalesce

One misses cricket hearth and croaking frog
Where no one bothered how one warmed one's bum
Yet from the City's pie pulled not one plum
