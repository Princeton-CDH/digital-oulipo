Prose took the minstrel's verse without a squeeze
His exaltation shocked both young and crone
The understanding critic firstly sees
'Ere meanings new to ancient tribes are thrown

They both are right not untamed mutterings
That metred rhyme alone can souls enslave
They both are right not unformed smatterings
That every verbal shock aims to deprave

Poetic licence needs no strain or stress
One tongue will do to keep the verse agog
From cool Parnassus down to wild Loch Ness

Bard I adore your endless monologue
Ventriloquists be blowed you strike me dumb
Soliloquies predict great things old chum
