Don Pedro from his shirt has washed the fleas
The bull's horns ought to dry it like a bone
Old coned-beef's rusty armour spreads disease
That suede ferments is not at all well known

To one sweet hour of bliss my memory clings
Signalling gauchos very rarely shave
An icicle of frozen marrow pings
As sleeping-bags the silent landscape pave

Staunch pilgrims longest journeys can't depress
What things we did we went the whole darned hog
And played their mountain croquet jungle chess

Southern baroque's seductive dialogue
Suits lisping Spanish tongues for whom say some
The bell tolls fee-less fi-less fo-less fum
